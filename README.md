# The-Saving-of-Chora
A <b>Windows</b> Python Text Adventure Game.

Hello and welcome to The Saving of Chora!
This <b>README</b> will guide you through the process of installing and playing the game. Enjoy!

<h1><b>**</b> INSTALLING <b>**</b></h1>
<hr>

* You <b>MUST</b> have Python 3.4 for this game to work. Any earlier version will crash the game.
* Download and extract the files INTO your PYTHON 3.4 folder.
* The path to the game MUST be as follows:
    * C:\Python34\The-Saving-of-Chora-master

* Once that is done, simply run the <b>setup.bat</b> file.

<b>If that doesn't work</b>, then:
* Open a cmd prompt.
* Use the command <b>cd</b> to navigate to the C:\Python34\The-Saving-of-Chora-master\Install directory (or wherever else you've installed the game).
* Navigate to each folder:
	* Once in each one (you'll know you're in the right one if the cmd prompt says <C:\Python34\The-Saving-of-Chora-master\Install\<b>blah blah</b>) (once again, or wherever you've installed the game.)
	* Use the command `python setup.py install`. The cmd prompt will install a bunch of stuff. When it stops and returns to the command line again, navigate back one folder, into the next one, and then do the same thing.
* Once all the packages have been installed, you're ready to start the game. Enjoy!

<h1><b>**</b> GAMEPLAY <b>**</b></h1>
<hr>

* The game is 1 dimensional. It's a text game. The only graphics are colours.
* Besides the colours, it's all up to you. Using single letter commands to do certain things is the way the game is played.
* When you see the words <b>"Type a command, type 'help', or press enter to move on...."</b>, type <b>"help"</b> if it's your first time playing.
* Besides typing help, messages will appear occasionally with tips, explanations (and sometimes even rewards!)

<h2>I hope you enjoy the game!</h2>
